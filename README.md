# CS5004 Project 6

#### Overview:

1. We are seeking to replace the data record with computer records where we can keep track of individual animals that are in care. As the sanctuary staff, we have to build the MVC model that provide us the view of the sanctuary, so that we can register new monkey, move the monkey from isolation to enclosure and can be able to view the monkeys' information in enclosure and sanctuary.

#### Feature:

Below is the feature of the program:
1. Register the monkey by inputting the monkey's Name, Species, Sex, Size, Weight, Age and its favourite food. Not require to input the healthiness of the monkey as it is defaulted to be unhealthy. 
2. The new monkey being registered would be put in isolation with its picture and the name shown. 
3. For the monkey living in the isloation, its name would be shown in the combobox. It allows us to select the monkey to be moved to enclosure. 
3. Able to move the selected monkey to the enclosure. Once the monkey is moved to enclosure, the monkey would be taken away from the isolation and moved to be shown in the row (enclosure for specific species) according to its species.
4. Able to select the list of every enclosure by choosing the specific species.
5. Able to list out the names of the monkeys living in sanctuary in alphabetical order.
